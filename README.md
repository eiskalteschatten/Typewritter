Typewritter
===========

Typewritter aims to be an easy-to-use backend for blogs that web developers can seemlessly implement into their existing web sites without having the hassle of editing complicated themes.


Progress
------------

Typewritter is still in its infancy and as such should not yet be used for anything serious since most of it doesn't work yet. Here is a list of the current development stages and their statuses:

**Stable**
- Create posts
- Edit posts

**Development**
- Markdown to HTML converter
- Automated install

**Planning**
- Multiple authors (login system)

**Not yet started**
- Create comments
- Edit comments
- Image uploader
- File (uploads) manager
- Simple, sandbox frontend
- Search posts

The list will continue to grow as more features are added or thought of.

Requirements
------------

- PHP 5 or higher
- MySQL
