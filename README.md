Typewritter
===========

Typewritter aims to be an easy-to-use backend for blogs that web developers can seemlessly implement into their existing web sites without having the hassle of editing complicated themes.


Progress
------------

Typewritter is still in its infancy and as such should not yet be used for anything serious since most of it doesn't work yet. Here is a list of the current development stages and their statuses:

**Stable**
- Create posts


**Development**
- Edit posts
- Automated install

**Panning**
- Markdown to HTML converter

**Not yet started**
- Multiple authors (login system)
- Create comments
- Edit comments
- Simple, sandbox frontend

The list will continue to grow as more features are added or thought of.

Requirements
------------

- PHP 5 or higher
- MySQL
