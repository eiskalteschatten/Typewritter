Typewritter
===========

Typewritter aims to be an easy-to-use backend for blogs that web developers can seemlessly implement into their existing web sites without having the hassle of editing complicated themes.

**Stable**
- Create posts

- Option for allowing HTML in posts

**Development**
- Categories
- Tags
- Automated install

**Planning**
- Multiple authors (login system)
- Schedule post publication

**Not yet started**

- Image uploader
- File (uploads) manager
- Simple, sandbox frontend
- Search posts
