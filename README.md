Typewritter
===========

Typewritter aims to be an easy-to-use backend for blogs that web developers can seemlessly implement into their existing web sites without having the hassle of editing complicated themes.


Progress
------------

Typewritter is still in its infancy and as such should not yet be used for anything serious since most of it doesn't work yet. Here is a list of the current development stages and their statuses:

- Automated install [development]
- Create posts [development]
- Edit posts [development]
- Markup to HTML converter [planning]
- Create comments [not yet started]
- Edit comments [not yet started]
- Multiple authors (login system) [not yet started]
- Simple, sandbox frontend [not yet started]

The list will continue to grow as more features are added or thought of.

Requirements
------------

- PHP 5 or higher
- MySQL
